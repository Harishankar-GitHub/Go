## Golang
- Golang is Compiled
	- Go tool can run file directly, without VM
	- Executables are different from OS
	- Executables are exported at the compile time.
	- Go gives the options to produce the compiled output or the final executables for windows/linux/mac.
- What is Golang ? Where can it be used ?
	- System Apps to Web Apps - Cloud
- Object Oriented ?
	- Yes and No
	- According to OOPS, a language should have Classes, Objects etc.
	- Golang doesn't have those. Instead it has Structs, which is an altenative.
	- Whatever one sees on the screen, the code just does that.
	- This is how Golang is designed.
- Missing
	- Few features that are available in other languages are missing in Golang.
	- One such thing is try - catch block.
	- And it is not needed in Go.
	- No need to write semi colon while coding in Golang.
		- But the document says semi colon is required,
		- Lexer does a lot of work.
